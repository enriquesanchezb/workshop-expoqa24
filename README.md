# Branch: 1-Simple-LLM

Welcome to the 1-simple-llm branch of our AI Testing workshop!

In this branch, you will work with a Jupyter Notebook to develop a simple language model that can autocomplete sentences based on training phrases.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository (if not already done):**
Ensure that you have cloned the main repository and are in the correct branch by using:
```
git checkout 1-simple-llm
```
2. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Using Google Colab:
     - Open Google Colab.
     - Click on File > Open notebook.
     - Select the GitHub tab and enter the repository URL.
     - Find and open the .ipynb file from this branch.
   - Using a Local Jupyter Setup:
     - Ensure you have Jupyter installed on your local machine. If not, install it using:
        ```
        pip install notebook
        ```
   - Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository and launch Jupyter:
        ```
        jupyter notebook
        ```
   - Open the `.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface.

## Completing the Exercise
Follow the instructions within the notebook. The exercise involves:
- Loading the training data.
- Training a simple language model.
- Testing the model to see how well it can autocomplete sentences.
- Save and Commit Your Work
After completing the exercise, save your notebook:
